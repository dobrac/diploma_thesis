The primary goal of this thesis is to develop a static HTML page that provides both developer-familiar documentation design and gRPC API interaction capabilities (assuming the API supports gRPC-web).
This project will leverage Protocol Buffer files, which define services, calls, and data types as input.
A key focus is to address the challenges of creating interactive gRPC API documentation by utilizing a static web page and tools facilitating conversion between the gRPC API definition and a format readily understood by the web page.

A comprehensive analysis of existing gRPC solutions, alongside comparable tools for RESTful and GraphQL APIs, will be conducted.
This analysis will examine features, strengths, and weaknesses, informing the specific requirements and use cases for the proposed web-based solution.

The implementation chapter centers on the creation of the static HTML page, enabling direct gRPC API calls.
Additionally, this page will incorporate the ability to automatically generate documentation leveraging gRPC reflection.

A testing phase will include both automated tests to verify functionality and user testing to evaluate the interface's overall usability and developer-familiar design.

The ultimate outcome of this work is to provide a valuable resource for developers building or using gRPC APIs.
This solution will streamline the process of creating interactive documentation, enhancing understanding and efficient use of gRPC services, and hosting the documentation website.
