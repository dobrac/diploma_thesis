For the testing of the website, I have prepared automated unit tests and manual scenarios.
The automated tests are written in the TypeScript programming language using the Jest~\footnote{\url{https://jestjs.io/}} framework.
The manual scenarios serve as a guide for the user testing of the website
and for verifying the correctness of the website's behavior.


\section{Automated Testing}
Using the Jest framework, I have created unit tests for the most critical parts of the website.
The tests cover the services and components of the website.
They are located in the \texttt{\_\_tests\_\_} directory.
The test coverage statistics are in the table~\ref{tab:tests-coverage}.

\begin{table}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        ~        & Statements & Branches & Functions & Lines   \\
        \hline
        Coverage & 82.21\%    & 94.3\%   & 63.21\%   & 82.21\% \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Test coverage statistics}
    \label{tab:tests-coverage}
\end{table}


\section{Manual Scenarios}
For the manual user testing of the website, I have created scenarios that cover all use cases.
Each scenario consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item initial state,
    \item steps,
    \item covered use cases.
\end{itemize}

In the individual steps, I describe how to achieve the result defined in the title of the testing scenario.

\newcommand{\testing}[2]{%
    \stepcounter{testingcounter}%
    \subsection{T\arabic{testingcounter} -- #1}
}
