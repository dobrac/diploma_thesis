\section{User Testing}
My goal for the user testing is to determine the website's intuitiveness and clarity and identify any issues.
As for the target user group, I have chosen developers.

I have created the following scenarios for the user testing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Common Format Generation from Proto Files,
    \item List Services, Methods, Message Types, and Enum Types,
    \item Comments and Options,
    \item Execute Unary Request,
    \item Execute Server Streaming Request,
    \item Complex Method Input,
    \item Global Metadata.
\end{itemize}

The scenarios are different from those for testing the functionality of the website
and do not cover the entire functionality
because the primary goal of user testing is the intuitiveness and clarity of the website.

Each user will be briefed about the website's general use case,
asked about their experience with similar pieces of software,
and then they will be asked to complete the scenarios
and provide feedback on the website's functionality and clarity.

The pre-questionnaire will be used to gather information about the user's experience with similar software.
The questions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is your main focus in programming?
    (software, hardware, web development, etc.)
    \item What is your experience with REST APIs or GraphQL?
    \item What is your experience with Swagger UI, GraphiQL, or similar tools?
    \item What is your experience with the gRPC?
\end{itemize}

The post-questionnaire will be used to gather feedback on the website's functionality and clarity.
The questions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How did you find the common format generation process?
    (rate 1--5, 1 being the best)
    \item How did you find the overall website design?
    (rate 1--5, 1 being the best)
    \item How difficult was it to find the methods, message types, and enums?
    (rate 1--5, 1 being the easiest)
    \item How difficult was it to control the method execution?
    (rate 1--5, 1 being the easiest)
    \item Is there anything else to add?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Format Generation from Proto Files}
The tester is provided with proto files and a script for generating a common format with its documentation.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
Based on the provided proto files, generate a common format that will be used later on for the documentation website.

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
A generated common format JSON file.

\subsection{List Services, Methods, Message Types, and Enum Types}
The tester is provided with the common format file.
The website is running on localhost on port 3000.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
You have a website running on the localhost on port 3000.
List all services, methods, message types, and enum types from the common format file.
Find the method \texttt{SayHello} and tell me what type it gives as a response.

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
The method is found, and the type is \texttt{HelloReply}.

\subsection{Comments and Options}
The tester is provided with the common format file.
The website is running on localhost on port 3000.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
You have a website running on the localhost on port 3000.
What does the method \texttt{ListFeatures} in the service \texttt{RouteGuide} do, and what is the \textit{java\_package} of that service?

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
The method obtains features within the given rectangle, and the \textit{java\_package} is \textit{guiding.route}.

\subsection{Execute Unary Request}
The tester is provided with the common format file.
The website runs on localhost on port 3000, and the gRPC-Web proxy with the gRPC server is set up.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
You have a website running on the localhost on port 3000.
Execute method \texttt{SayHello} with their parameters and tell me the response with their headers and trailers.

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
The method is executed with any parameter
and the response is \enquote{Hello Name} in the \texttt{message} field of the response message type.

\subsection{Execute Server Streaming Request}
The tester is provided with the common format file.
The website runs on localhost on port 3000, and the gRPC-Web proxy with the gRPC server is set up.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
You have a website running on the localhost on port 3000.
Execute method \texttt{SayRepeatHello} with their parameters and tell me the responses with their headers and trailers.

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
The method is executed with any parameter
and the response is \enquote{Hello Name} multiple times in the \texttt{message} field of the response message type.

\subsection{Complex Method Input}
The tester is provided with the common format file.
The website runs on localhost on port 3000, and the gRPC-Web proxy with the gRPC server is set up.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
You have a website running on the localhost on port 3000.
Execute method \texttt{ListFeatures} with their parameters and tell me the responses.
The parameters are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{lo}: latitude: 400000000, longitude: -750000000,
    \item \texttt{hi}: latitude 420000000, longitude -73000000.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
The method is executed with the parameters, and responses are returned.

\subsection{Global Metadata}
The tester is provided with the common format file and authorization token.
The website runs on localhost on port 3000, and the gRPC-Web proxy with the gRPC server is set up.

\textbf{The following instructions are given:}\\
You have a website running on the localhost on port 3000.
Execute method \texttt{SayHello} with the authorization token.

\textbf{The expected result is:}\\
The method is executed, and the authorization token is present in the request metadata section.

\subsection{Testing Results}
The testing has been conducted with five developers, regardless of their experience with gRPC\@.
The goal was to determine the website's intuitiveness and clarity and identify any issues.
The individual testing reports follow in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Tester 1}
The first tester is an undergraduate student in computer science.

\hfill

\textbf{Pre-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mobile applications and hardware.
    \item Using them every day.
    \item Using them at work for documentation, checking, and testing the APIs.
    \item Heard of, but never used.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Post-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1 -- It is clear and simple to use, but he would prefer a button for the generation in the UI\@.
    \item 2 -- Good, clear overview.
    The metadata button is not clear.
    It feels like submitting the row.
    \item 1 -- All good.
    \item 1 -- All clear, familiar design and controls to the Swagger UI\@.
    \item No.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Individual scenarios:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item The first method execution was done without any parameters (that is acceptable by gRPC, so it is not an issue).
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item All was done as expected.
    He did not expect the number after a name in the response message (not part of my implementation; it is related to the backend).
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tester 2}
The second tester is an undergraduate student in computer science.

\hfill

\textbf{Pre-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Web development, full-stack.
    \item Using them actively.
    \item Rarely used, but when used, he uses them for documentation and API design checking.
    The testing of endpoints is usually done using Postman.
    \item None.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Post-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item 1 -- All clear, similar to Swagger UI\@.
    The only complaint is that the red color in client streaming invokes there is an error.
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item The metadata button was also expected in the method request, but he does not know how it is done in Swagger UI\@.
    (He found it very quickly regardless.)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Individual scenarios:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All done as expected.
    \item He could not say the returned message type frame is the returned type.
    But he guessed the correct place quickly without any help.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item When he executed the method, he thought the request shown body was the response body.
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item The execution was done as expected.
    The only confusion was that he was unsure if the response was a list or multiple responses.
    He has suggested adding a title to each response.
    \item He could not find the input for the \texttt{lo} parameter before executing the method.
    It was caused by him playing with the application previously and accidentally changing the tab to the model.
    After pointing him to the correct tab, he found the input, and the rest was done as expected.
    It was more of a testing preparation issue than an application issue connected with the stress of being a tester.
    \item All done as expected.
\end{enumerate}

The third tester is an undergraduate student in computer science.

\hfill

\textbf{Pre-questionnaire answers:}

    \item None.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Post-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item 2 -- Server streaming responses were too long, so the page became too long.
    The suggestion is to add scrolling, or a max height, or collapse the responses.
    The rest was clear.
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item He would add the metadata button in the method request, not only globally.

\textbf{Individual scenarios:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item When he executed the method, he thought the request shown body was the response body.
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected, but when he had sent the request, he was waiting for the loading on the executed button to end.
    So, he did not see the responses as they were coming.
    \item He could not find the global metadata settings because he did not connect metadata with authorization.
    The rest was done as expected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tester 4}
The fourth tester is a software developer with a master's degree in computer science.

\hfill

\textbf{Pre-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Web engineering, backend development in Typescript.
    \item Every day.
    \item Not much usage, but he knows what they are.
    He uses the OpenAPI specification for REST APIs instead of Swagger UI\@.

\textbf{Post-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1 -- All was clear.
    \item 1 -- Similar to Swagger UI, so all was clear.
    \item 1 -- He was not sure about the returned type model.
    The rest was clear.
    \item 1 -- He was looking for a while for the button to execute the method, but he missed it because it was too wide.
    The rest was clear.
    \item If the gRPC API were larger, it would be good to have collapsible services/types/enums sections.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Individual scenarios:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All done as expected.
    \item He could not say if the returned type is the message body or the whole message type.
    But he eventually remembered it was the whole message type.
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item He could not find the execution button because it was too long, and thought it was a heading.
    But he had eventually found it.
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item He was looking for metadata in the method but quickly found it at the top.
    He has suggested making the button or header sticky at the top.
    He has also pointed out that the Bearer prefix addition seems unnecessary as there might be other types of authorization that this might not work with.
    The rest was done as expected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tester 5}
The fourth tester is a software developer with a master's degree in computer science.

\hfill

\textbf{Pre-questionnaire answers:}

    Wrote a framework for Node.js and gRPC\@.
    Worked a lot with the core library.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Post-questionnaire answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1 -- He would like to have the reflection URL directly.
    Otherwise, it was all good.
    \item 1 -- Similar to Swagger UI, so all was clear.
    An idea is adding a badge to the metadata button to symbolize an authorization header set state.
    \item 1 -- All good.
    He has stressed the importance of being able to use the \verb|ctrl+F| (find text on the page) shortcut.
    He also appreciated the model preview in the input form while writing the JSON data.
    \item 1 -- All good, similar to the Swagger UI\@.
    He appreciated the instant response feedback.
    \item All good.
    A suggestion is to add a link to a user guide at the top of the page.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\textbf{Individual scenarios:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All done as expected.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item He had skipped the comment and told what the method does based on the input and output types, which was correct, but overlooked the comment message.
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item First, he was confused by the request with the response.
    Then, confused the headers with the response message.
    The rest was done as expected.
    \item Confused what the \textit{streaming} text in response title means, though did not have any effect on the expectations or actions.
    The rest was done as expected.
    Suggested scrollbar or collapse of the server responses as the server streaming requests are usually used for monitoring data.
    \item All done as expected.
    \item He has tried to set the authorization headers manually, which is fine and also works.
    The rest was done as expected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Found Issues and Their Solutions}\label{subsec:found-issues-and-their-solutions}
The overall feedback was positive, and the testers found the website intuitive and straightforward.
However, a few issues were found, and they are listed in the table~\ref{tab:user-testing-issues} with their respective solutions.
The changes in the UI are shown in the figure~\ref{fig:testing-screenshots}.

The slightly lighter color scheme and the change of color for client streaming are shown in figure~\ref{fig:testing-changes-background-colors} to solve the confusion with the method being in the error state.
Then the figure~\ref{fig:testing-changes-response} shows added \enquote{OK} text to explain the \enquote{0} response status, alongside added \enquote{Response message type} title to hint the user about the response type.
The figure~\ref{fig:testing-changes-cancel} shows a dark border around the execute button to emphasize it, and also the cancel button to the right instead of being underneath.

The metadata renaming to the \enquote{Metadata \& Authorization} with the larger space on the left and making the method input and the base gRPC URL input smaller, shown in the figure~\ref{fig:testing-changes-top-bar}, is there to prevent a submit button perception and to explain the authorization definition action.
Also, a count badge was added to the metadata button to show the number of set metadata and authorization headers.
After clicking the metadata button, a modal dialog is opened.
Changes to that dialog are shown in the figure~\ref{fig:testing-changes-metadata}.
The colors for the set and close buttons have been switched to underline the primary actions, compared to the secondary close.
Another change is in the authorization section, where additional types were added with the preview of the final metadata key-value pair that will be added when the authorization is set.

The responses list has been redesigned with the addition of the title to each response message and the total response count.
It is shown in the figure~\ref{fig:testing-changes-responses}.
Another change is the addition of a maximum height for the response container.
Its height is fixed to 50\% of the view height, and it automatically scrolls to the bottom, if not scrolled, as new messages arrive.
This also helps with having too long message responses.

            \hline
            The metadata button does not show a clear connection with authorization.
            & Renamed the button to \enquote{Metadata \& Authorization} (\ref{fig:testing-changes-top-bar}).
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            The metadata button invokes the feeling of submitting the row (not opening a modal).
            & Added greater space between the button and the input fields.
            Also, make the input fields smaller so the button is much larger.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-top-bar})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            Swapping the request with the response after the method execution.
            & Changed the request background color to white to match the metadata and highlight the heading.
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            The metadata is also expected in the execution of the method.
            & Having only global metadata is a design decision based on the Swagger UI.
            The idea is that the metadata is usually the same for all methods, such as authorization.
            & Will not fix \\
            \hline
            The red color background in client streaming invokes there is an error.
            & The background colors have been redone to be lighter.
            Also, the client streaming color was changed to yellow.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-background-colors})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            It is hard to distinguish the returned message type from the body of the message type.
            & Added description of the response status code and the title for the returned message type.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-response})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            Confusion if the responses are a response as a list or a list of responses.
            & Added a title to each response with the message number and total count at the end.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-responses})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            Server streaming methods can have too many responses, making the page too long.
            & The responses are now scrollable in a fixed-height container.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-responses})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            The responses are not distinguished from the headers.
            & Added titles to each response and the total count.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-responses})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            Not seeing the responses as they are coming, waiting for the loading on the executed button to end.
            & Relocated the cancel button to the right side of the execution button.
            Changed the responses to be shown in a fixed-height container.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-cancel})
            Also, this was more related to the tester's stress, where, in reality, they would scroll sooner.
            & Partially fixed \\
            \hline
            If the gRPC API were larger, it would be good to have collapsible services/types/enums sections.
            & Added collapsible sections for services, message types, and enum types.
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            The button for execution is too long, so it is mistaken for the heading.
            & The button's width is designed based on the Swagger UI, but its color, border, and icon (in front of the text) were changed to increase visibility.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-cancel})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            The close button on the metadata modal is mistaken for the set button in the authorization.
            & The close button is now a secondary color, and the set button is a primary color.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-metadata})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            There may be other types of authorization than Bearer.
            & Added more authorization types, such as Basic and API Key.
            Otherwise, the use of authorization is optional, and the user can always use the metadata directly.
            (\ref{fig:testing-changes-metadata})
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            Have the gRPC reflection URL directly on the website.
            & That is not possible because of the gRPC browser limitations and the static website (backendless) hosting.
            & Will not fix \\
            \hline
            Add authorization metadata set state badge.
            & Added a badge of the set metadata headers count.
            & Fixed \\
            \hline
            Add a user guide link at the top of the page.
            & This might be added in the future if the solution is public (the user guide is part of the GitHub repository), but as of now, it will not be added.
            & Will not fix \\
