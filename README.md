The aim of the work is to design and implement a static web presentation generator for gRPC API documentation. The input files are proto files that carry a description of services, calls and types. The output is an HTML page with documentation and the ability to call the API (provided that the API supports gRPC-web).
1. Research existing solutions for Protocol Buffers and compare features with similar tools for GraphQL or RESTful APIs.
2. Design and implement a documentation generator with the ability to call an existing gRPC-web API.
3. Discuss and possibly implement an alternative data source using gRPC reflection.
4. Test the application with automated tests and perform user testing.
